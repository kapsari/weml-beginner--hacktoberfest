College brochures talk about stadiums, gymnasiums, AC classrooms, and what not to get you in. This is useless. You're going to study on "borrowed" money. Luxury can wait. Don't fall into this trap while deciding on colleges.

Go to a college which is cheap. Fewer loans will give you the freedom to learn new things on the side and even after college. Low fees help!
